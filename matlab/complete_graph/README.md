# Simulations on the Complete Graph

The important files in this folder are the functions.

They are
- simulate_diffeq.m, which simulates the differential equation from the mitzenmacher paper.
- ctmc_simulation.m, which uses a continuous time markov chain to simulate the complete graph,
					 and compares with the differential equation simulation.
